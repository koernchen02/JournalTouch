# About
JournalTouch provides a touch-optimized, responsive interface for browsing current journal table-of-contents.

# Quickstart
## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have Apache and PHP available. Nothing else is needed
2. Be aware that much of the fun is with showing covers. But there we don't (really) know freely available sources. JournalTocs Premium offers cover links, yet is not free. With version 0.4 JournalTouch introduces a way to easily donwload cover. But make sure to read the disclaimer in the admin menu very carefully - you might lack legal rights to use it at all.

# DEVELOPMENT BRANCH
this is the main development branch. things here may be broken or badly documented or both.

the next release will be **0.4**, features and issues related to them should reference the homonymous milestone.

If you want to use JournalTouch, please check out the stable version from the **master** branch (at tag 0.3, if in doubt).

We're using the git-flow project structure, for more information, please refer to the [Wiki] (https://github.com/bibliocoll/JournalTouch/wiki/Contributing)

## Translations
- If you want to change translations you can use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) - it's free.
- As of version 0.4 many thing can be translated in the Settings menu in the admin panel :)
